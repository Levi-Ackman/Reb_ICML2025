Dear Area Chair,

We are writing to address the recent rollback of our review scores, which we understand was implemented due to the unfortunate incident of reviewer information leakage, as per ICLR policy.

We wish to declare and confirm that the improved ratings our paper received were based entirely on the official, documented discussion and rebuttal process conducted within the OpenReview system.

**Fact Summary**:

Current Rolled-Back Scores: The scores currently displayed in the system are [8, 6, 4].

Improved Scores Before Rollback: Prior to the policy action, our ratings had been officially updated by the reviewers to [8, 8, 6].

**Basis of Improvement**: 

This improvement to [8, 8, 6] was achieved through substantive engagement with the reviewers' concerns during the official discussion period, which took place before ***November 24, 2025***.

We assure you that no unofficial or external contact with any reviewer was made at any point. All arguments, clarifications, and responses that led to the improved consensus are fully recorded in the public discussion logs.

Furthermore, we assert that the information leakage incident (***November 27, 2025***) that triggered the rollback policy occurred after the reviewers had already officially updated their scores (***November 24, 2025***). Therefore, the legitimate score improvement was completed before the policy-mandated rollback became necessary.

We respectfully request that you review the complete official discussion thread for the paper. The logs will clearly demonstrate that the final improved ratings were justified based on the merit of our response and the documented discussion, and were not influenced by any information leakage.

Thank you for your time and careful consideration of this matter.

Sincerely,

*The Authors*
